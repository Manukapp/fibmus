Fibromyalgia fMRI listening to music and noise. Public dataset. I use FSL to pre-process, including ICA-AROMA.

In output/Analysis folder the text files are for FSL to use for detecting events within the fMRI scans. It is based on the following FSL tutorial by Andrew Jahn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPR2v0mOxk8&list=PL3AAFC4A67F1B6FAB&index=4
